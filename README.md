Yoga is a practice that combines physical postures, breathing exercises, and meditation to improve overall health. It is a spiritual discipline that aims to bring harmony between the mind and body. The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit root "yuj", which means "to join" or "to unite".

What is yoga and its benefits?
The practice of yoga asanas develops strength and flexibility, while soothing your nerves and calming your mind. The asanas affect the muscles, joints and skin, and the whole body â€“ glands, nerves, internal organs, bones, respiration and the brain.
